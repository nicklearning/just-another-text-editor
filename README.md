# Just Another Text Editor (JATE)

## Description

Just Another Text Editor (JATE) is a progressive web application (PWA) aimed at providing a simple yet powerful text editing experience. It was built as a practice project to learn and demonstrate the usage of webpack for bundling and managing dependencies.

The motivation behind JATE was to create a lightweight and efficient text editor that can be accessed from any device with a web browser. By building this project, I aimed to enhance my understanding of webpack and improve my skills in web development.

JATE solves the problem of needing a text editor on-the-go without the need for installing additional software. 

Through the development of JATE, I learned how to effectively use webpack to bundle JavaScript modules, manage assets, and optimize performance for web applications.
